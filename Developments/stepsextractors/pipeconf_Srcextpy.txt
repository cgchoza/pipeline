# Stoneedge Pipeline Configuration File - For Automatic Data Reduction
#
# 2008-11-3 Marc Berthoud Version 0.1: Configuration file for Pipeline Testing
# 2012 Marc Berthoud: Numerous updates
# 2013-10-09 Nicholas Chapman: Made a config validation file
# 2017-07-28 Atreyo Pal config file (added bdf section, removed KEYS)
# 2020-09-17 Daniel Sharkey: Added SrcExtPy Config, and updated params.

### Data Handling Section

# Treatement of the FITS header: can include keyword replacement
# The keyword value and comment must be printed as they would in a FITS header
# If the value is another keyword, the value of that keyword will be used
# instead (This only works if the other keywords starts with an alphabetic
# character).

# Treatement for table values when combining images
# Options are MIN, MED, AVG, FIRST, LAST, SUM
